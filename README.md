# Ridge vs Lasso Regression Project

![Project Flowchart](1)

## Overview

This project provides a hands-on comparison between two powerful regression techniques: **Ridge Regression** and **Lasso Regression**. Using a real-world housing dataset, the workflow demonstrates how regularization impacts model performance and feature selection. The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Project Flow

The workflow follows a clear and professional structure, as illustrated in the flowchart above:

1. **Import Libraries**  
   Essential Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization are imported.

2. **Load and Explore Data**  
   The housing data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Initial exploration includes checking for missing values, understanding feature distributions, and basic statistics.

3. **Preprocess Data**  
   The data is cleaned and prepared for modeling:
   - Handling missing values (if any)
   - Feature selection and engineering
   - Data normalization or scaling

4. **Split Data**  
   The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to enable unbiased evaluation of model performance.

5. **Regression Modeling**
   - **Ridge Regression**  
     - L2 penalty (`lambda * sum(wi^2)`) is added to the loss function.
     - The Ridge model is fit to the training data.
     - Predictions are made on the test set.
     - Model is evaluated using metrics: R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
   - **Lasso Regression**  
     - L1 penalty (`lambda * sum(|wi|)`) is added to the loss function.
     - The Lasso model is fit to the training data.
     - Predictions are made on the test set.
     - Model is evaluated using metrics: R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
     - Some coefficients may be set exactly to zero, illustrating Lasso's feature selection property.

6. **Performance Comparison & Analysis**
   - Both models are compared in terms of predictive power and the effect of regularization.
   - Lasso's ability to perform automatic feature selection is highlighted.
   - The impact of regularization strength (`alpha`) on model performance is discussed.

7. **Conclusion**
   - Insights into when to prefer Ridge vs. Lasso regression.
   - Real-world interpretation of results for housing price prediction.

## Files

- `Ridge and Lasso Regression_project_1.ipynb` – Main implementation notebook, containing code, outputs, and analysis.
- `README.md` – This documentation.

## Results & Insights

- **Ridge Regression:**  
  Controls the magnitude of coefficients but does not eliminate features.
- **Lasso Regression:**  
  Can zero out coefficients, effectively performing feature selection, and may improve interpretability.
- **Model Selection:**  
  Choose Ridge when all features are believed to be relevant and multicollinearity is present. Choose Lasso when feature selection is desired.
